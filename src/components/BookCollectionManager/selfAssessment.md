# Self assessment of BookCollectionManager

## Strengths:

- **State Management:** The code has the useState hook to manage state of the fields and the books.

- **Tailwind styles** I used Tailwind for the styles, as I' planning to use it on the project as well. 

- **Readability:** I think the code is easy to read and understand.

## Areas for Improvement:

- **Validation:** There is no input validation for the text fields. I could've added a function to prevent empty fields.

- **Error Handling:** The code doesn't have any error handling for the state variables or input errors
